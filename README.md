# Advent of Code 2024

A bunch of code I've create to compete in the 2024 Advent of Code challenge.

My approach for this year:

* Continue to improve my Golang craft
* Use TDD - possibly less of a focus on this - we'll see!

![GitHub go.mod Go version (subdirectory of monorepo)](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/hellboy1975/aoc2023)


## Usage

Clone this repo to your file system directory of choice, and make sure you have Go 1.21.4 installed

Build the project with:

```
go build -o ./bin
```

Run a specific day with a command like:

```
./bin/aoc2024 -day=1 -part=1
```

For limited help:

```
./bin/aoc2024 -h
Usage of ./aoc2024:
  -day int
        which day to run (default 1)
  -part int
        which part to run (default 1)
```

Run all of the tests with:

```
go test ./...
```

## Day notes
